# 🤖 Intelligent CHATBOT   Web Application Using Deep Learning & Flask

### Project Summary
This Project Is An Interactive **AI Powered CHATBOT** Built With **Flask** And **Tensorflow**.  
It Uses A Trained Deep Learning Model To Understand User Inputs And Respond Conversationally Through A Simple And Responsive Web Interface.  
The Model Is Loaded Using Keras, While Flask Serves As The Backend Framework To Handle API Requests And Render The Frontend Chat UI.

---

### 🎯 Objective
- Develop An End To End CHATBOT Capable Of Responding Intelligently To User Queries.  
- Deploy The CHATBOT As A **Flask Web Application** That Can Run Both Locally And On The Cloud (Render).  
- Demonstrate Model Integration, Data Preprocessing, And Real Time Response Handling.  
- Build A Simple, Clean UI Using **HTML (Jinja2 Templates)** For User Interaction.

---

### 🧠 Key Insights
- The CHATBOT   Leverages A Trained **Tensorflow/Keras Model (`CHATBOT_Model.h5`)** For Text Classification And Intent Recognition.  
- **NLTK** Is Used For Natural Language Preprocessing Such As Tokenization And Stemming.  
- The App Exposes An Endpoint (`/CHATBOT`) To Receive User Queries And Return Responses As JSON.  
- The Project Demonstrates A Full ML Lifecycle: Model Loading → Inference → Flask Integration → Web Deployment.
